* Regular best practices
* Native code
* Native design
* Native features

## The idea
This project serves a few different purposes:
* a show off project for my resume
* make mental health tools more accessible
* help my own mental health

Many tools are just too expensive at 20â‚¬ a month, especially for students who have to take enormous ammounts of pressure but are poor by design. I had no money myself but I had therapy thanks to German healthcare, though that's basically it. So this shall be a solution made by a patient for the patient at no cost. It might sound silly, but it helps a lot to simply see in an app that your week was not as bad as your depression makes you remember it.
This is how I can try to be a part of the change I want to see in the world. I hope you can make good use of it.

Peawell aims to remain ad free, free of charge but with the option to donate.
