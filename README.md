# Peawell-iOS

## The idea
This project serves a few different purposes:
* a show off project for my resume
* make mental health tools more accessible
* help my own mental health
Many tools are just too expensive at 20€ a month, especially for students who have to take enormous ammounts of pressure. I had no money but I had therapy thanks to German healthcare but that's basically it. So this shall be a solution made by a patient for the patient at no cost. It might sound silly, but it helps a lot to simply see in an app that your week was not as bad as your depression makes you remember it.
This is how I can try to be a part of the change I want to see in the world. I hope you can make good use of it.

Peawell aims to remain ad free, free of charge but with the option to donate.
